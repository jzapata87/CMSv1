This is a project where I learned a great deal from.  I wanted to see if I could clone Medium's CMS or the editor.  I really did not have a path to follow before I began.  It was approached in a very hacky way.  I was
essentially just trying to tweak things here and there while at the same time learning how things worked. I googled a whole bunch.

Just clone the repository and run the following command to get it up and running.  Nothing to complicated.

npm start
```


## Usage example

Just click on any of the buttons on the site and type in the text input areas and see how they affect
